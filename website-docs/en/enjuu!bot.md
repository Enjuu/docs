Enjuu has it's own Discord bot that can be used to display user profiles or for checking out a player's best/recent scores. For anyone that doesn't know what commands the bot has to offer, what they do and how they work, here's a small introduction on what the commands do and how to use them.

__The prefix for every command is eb:__

Command | Description
------------ | -------------
eb:last <Player> | Shows the most recent score for the player.
eb:best <Player> | Shows the best score for the player.
eb:isonline <Player> | Checks if the player is online.
eb:user <Player> | Shows the profile of the player.
eb:invite <Player> | Invites this bot to your server.
