Donators get a lot of extra features while supporting the game. The set price for the Donator features are usually 3€/month, but the price can be subject to change. Enjuu does not currently support an automated procedure for donations, because of this all donations are handled manually and require additional contact with the Admins.

### Features:
- Custom Discord role, with a sublime yellow color
- Yellow name in-game, showing that you support the game
- Custom profile background
- Donator badge
- Friend rankings
- Unlimited stats, country and name changes
- A personalized profile badge, which you can customize all you want

**So how do I go about donating?**
If after all this you're convinced about donating to the server, please do send a message to Kazuki or Enjuu (Justin), preferably through discord :3
