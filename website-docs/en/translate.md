You can check out our GitHub repository for all the documentation and make pull requests! If you don't have a GitHub account, however, you can send me a message on Discord: **Enjuu** and I can give you the full documentation so you can translate it to your language. If you translate the full documentation, you will receive the contributor role in our Discord!
